# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Landscape Image Generation

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic and high-quality landscape images. GANs are a class of machine learning models designed for generative tasks, and in this case, they will be employed to create novel landscape scenes.

## Objectives

1. **Image Generation:** Train a GAN on a landscape dataset to generate new and diverse landscape images.
2. **Realism Enhancement:** Improve the realism and quality of generated images over training iterations.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a collection of landscape images used for training the GAN. It includes various types of landscapes, such as mountains, forests, beaches, and urban scenes. The diversity in the dataset contributes to the model's ability to generate a wide range of landscape types.


## GAN Model Training

- **Generator Network:** Develop a neural network to generate landscape images.
- **Discriminator Network:** Construct a neural network to distinguish between real and generated images.
- **Adversarial Training:** Train the generator and discriminator networks in an adversarial manner.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore optimization of GAN hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Conditional GANs:** Implement conditional GANs for specific landscape types or styles.

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch
- cv2
